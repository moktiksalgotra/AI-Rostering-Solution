- **Google Privacy**: Google's Speech Recognition API is subject to Google's privacy policy

## Customization

### Adjusting Timeout Settings

You can modify the timeout settings in `utils/speech_recognition.py`:

```python
# In the listen_and_convert method
audio = self.recognizer.listen(
    source, 
    timeout=5,        # Time to wait for speech to start (seconds)
    phrase_time_limit=10  # Maximum time for a single phrase (seconds)
)
```

### Changing Microphone Device

If you have multiple microphones, you can specify which one to use:

```python
# In the SpeechToText class
def set_microphone(self, device_index: int):
    self.microphone = sr.Microphone(device_index=device_index)
```
